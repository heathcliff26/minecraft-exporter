# minecraft-exporter

This is a prometheus exporter for minecraft stats.
It collects metrics from the save folder, as well as over RCON.
This includes advancements, player stats, Tick stats and dynmap stats.
The exporter is implemented purely in golang for a small image and memory footprint.

Before i created this exporter, i used the one from [Joshi425](https://github.com/Joshi425/minecraft-exporter), which is why the dashboard looks nearly identical.
However it seems the other exporter is abandoned, so i wrote my own.
There is zero compatibility to the other exporter.

### Reduced Metrics

In order to save metrics usage, the option to reduce the metrics series that will be exposed can be enabled in the configuration.

If the option is enabled, all `minecraft_stat_blocks_*` metrics will only contain the total per player, instead of per block. This results in significantly less metrics, as there won't be a series per player per block.

### RCON Metrics

The following metrics will be exposed when RCON is enabled:

| Metric                    | Description                                      |

| `forge_ticktime_dim`     | Time a Tick took in a Dimension  |
| `forge_tps_overall`      | Overall TPS                      |
